Welcome to my stupidly simple website.
It does not do much yet.
But it WILL — because I’m apparently a fucking iOS developer and web developer now. Surprise.
This repo is basically me yelling into the void with HTML and CSS until something cool happens.

What’s Actually In Here

index.html — the fragile beating heart of this operation
probably some CSS I stole from myself
whatever random shit I decide to throw in later
good intentions
bad decisions

Tech Stack

HTML5 (caveman edition)
CSS3 (held together with duct tape)
GitHub Pages (free hosting because I’m not paying shit for this right now)
No frameworks. No build tools.
Just pure, uncut, artisanal chaos.

Future Plans

Add real content
Maybe a bio?
Maybe links to the apps I’m building?
Maybe a section called “Ideas I Came Up With While Drunk”?
Maybe a page just for Guinness (the dog, not the beer — but maybe also the beer)
Basically whatever the hell I feel like

Contact
Eventually there will be a “contact me” link.
